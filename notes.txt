1. Card component with: image, name
2. Table component with a list of Cards
3. Scoreboard with current score and best score
4. Header with game title and scoreboard + instructions

Logic:
Game finisches when user clicks wrong image or all images
Best scores is updated only when game finishes and when is greater than prevScore
Fetching of imgs should happen on render of table component and img is passed as prop
On each click on a card:
1 checks if cardId is in the array 
2 if not that cardId is stored 
3 if array length is number of cards or cardId is present, game finishes and state is resetted

Flow of the app:
On first load compnents are rendered, fetching of images ahappen when table comp is rendered.
on array of totNm is created and then used with map for rendering cards
